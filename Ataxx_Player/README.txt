I hereby acknowledge the following sources that helped me finish this
assignment (fellow students, books, internet, ...) and how they contributed:

1. Slides Provided by Professor Michael Buro: Part 2 and Part 3
	I learned the main algorithms (MiniMax, Alpha-Beta, using Transposition
	Tables, etc.) from the lectures and slides.
2. en.cppreference.com
	I used this website to refer to known and unknown functions and libraries
	when required (while I was writing the code)
3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-5-zobrist-hashing/
	I learned the Zobrist Hashing technique from this website
