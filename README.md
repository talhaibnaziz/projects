# Projects
Projects: The ReadMe files of the specific projects are in the specific folders.
## Overview
The folder "Contest Programming" contains almost all of the codes from my online competitive programming career. Of course except the inter-university and intra-university contests as I had to submit those on-site. The remaining folders contain different projects that I have developed or helped develop throughout my coding lifetime. The following projects have been tested recently and should be working fine in the right conditions:
1. Ataxx_Player
2. Ataxx_Player_V2
3. Slide_Tile_Solver
4. Safari_RushHour
5. WDDF
