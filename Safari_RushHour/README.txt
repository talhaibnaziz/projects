I hereby acknowledge the following sources that helped me finish this
assignment (fellow students, books, internet, ...) and how they contributed:

1. Slides Provided by Professor Michael Buro: Part 6 and Part 7
	I learned how to use Transposition Tables in Single Agent Search and got
	ideas for different Heuristic values.
2. en.cppreference.com
	I used this website to refer to known and unknown functions and libraries
	when required (while I was writing the code)
