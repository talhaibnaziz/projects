		As a woman with disabilities, after perceiving the imperceptible, insubstantial discrimination of different institutions as well as everlasting discrimination of the society; in 2003, on the basis of discussion, along with a group of educated women with different types of
		disabilities came to a decision that, we should have a preset platform of women with disabilities; from where we will be able to raise our voice with the Government along with Non-Government organizations to condense discrimination against women with disabilities. Subsequently,
		for four years, to adopt different programs about women with disabilities, on the perspective of the demands and opinions of women with disabilities through organizing them; in November 2007, our group has obtained registration in the name of Women with Disabilities Development
		Foundation (WDDF) from Join Stock Companies and Firms. In the consequence of Unanimous dedication, hard work and concentration, WDDF, a number of well wishers, allies and donor organizations have come forward and we would like to express our interminable gratitude to them. WDDF
		has expectations along with intention to work for all types of WWDs around the country in accordance with it's capability. It is a unique dream of WDDF that, WWDs will be honoured through their job and they will be able to keep contribution in socio-economic development of the state.
		WDDF is the own voice of Women with Disabilities; which will establish a dignified society for them through preventing persecution along with elimination discrimination.

		policy and action plans through involving in different committees with Government and keeping contribution to develop accessible infrastructure of the state for WWDs. WDDF is making continuous advocacy with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs(MOWCA), department and Architecture 
		department to make accessible government women shelterhome in Five divisional towns of Bangladesh. Government One Stop Crisis Centres (OCC) located at divisional medical colleges are providing services to WWDs which has been observed by WDDF with uprightness. WDDF is determined to develop 
		leadership of WWDs in grassroot level.

    <p>
		The estimated number of Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) in Bangladesh, is around 15 million people, 
		which constitutes 15 % of total population. 10% of Population have a disability. Half of these are 
		female. This is 12 Million girls and women with  disabilities (WWDs). These large number of girls and
		Women with Disabilities (WWDs) in Bangladesh are one of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged segment 
		of the society. They are always discriminated based on gender, disabled and all too often, poorest of 
		the poor. They are frequently subjected to discrimination both directly and indirectly and also negative 
		attitudes and stereotyping. Although there are class differences, all WWDs face varying degrees of 
		discrimination considering types and situations. <br> <br>

		WWDs often stigmatized and neglected from early childhood, many girls with disabilities are grown up 
		in the lacking of a sense of their own self worth and dignity. Most of them are isolated from mainstream 
		society, stigmatized, mistreated and marginalized. WWDs are deprived of basic needs including access to 
		health service, housing, education, transportation, vocational training, employment, income generating 
		opportunities as well as other social and community activities. inspite of having the responsibility of 
		Bangladesh government to include women in the development process, but all mainstreaming policies have 
		been formulated and declared exclusive of women with disabilities.
		
		"WWDs are exposed to a greater risk of physical and sexual abuse, for the most part of which takes place within the context of their own families."
		
		Initiatives of Government and Non-Government Organizations fail to consider the specific needs of WWDs 
		and children with Disabilities. Rather to a certain extent, WWDs have often been marginalized both within 
		Women’s organizations, Non-Government Organizations and Disabled People’s Organizations. in the consequence, 
		their views have not been addressed in broader advocacy agenda. Due to these grounds, the representation 
		of girls and Women With Disabilities are very disproportionate and they are always among the “poorest of 
		the poor”. Due to the lack of confidence, professionalism, understanding on human rights, shortage of their 
		leadership qualities and skillness, the development of WWDs has always been restricted and these are 
		existing as the major barriers for them to establish and manage their own organizations.
		
		<br><br>
		In view of the aforementioned state of affairs, WDDF has given foundation in 2007, with vigorous efforts 
		of a group of prospective women leaders with disabilities. WDDF maintains an integrated three-tier 
		management system as follows:
			<br>->General Council- 27
			<br>->Executive Council-7, and
			<br>->WDDF Headquarter.
		<br><br>
		WDDF has given foundation from this contemplation that: “WWDs are not alone. Their united and interminable 
		endeavor will keep contribution to create an inclusive, right-based and antidiscriminatory state for all 
		including WWDs through their proper empowerment.
