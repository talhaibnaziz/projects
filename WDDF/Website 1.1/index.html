					<h2>Welcome to WDDF</h2>
					<p>
						The estimated number of Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) in Bangladesh, is around 15 million people, which constitutes 
						15 % of total population. 15% of Population have a disability. Half of these are female. This is 12 Million girls and 
						women with disabilities (WWDs). These large number of girls and Women with Disabilities (WWDs) in Bangladesh are one of 
						the most vulnerable and disadvantaged segment of the society. They are always discriminated based on gender, disabled 
						and all too often, poorest of the poor. They are frequently subjected to discrimination both directly and indirectly 
						and also negative attitudes and stereotyping. Although there are class differences, all WWDs face varying degrees of 
						discrimination considering types and situations. WWDs are exposed to a greater risk of physical and sexual abuse, for 
						the most part of which takes place within the context of their own families. WWDs often stigmatized and neglected from 
						early childhood, many girls with disabilities are grown up in the lacking of a sense of their own self worth and dignity. 
						Most of them are isolated from mainstream society, stigmatized, mistreated and marginalized. WWDs are deprived of basic 
						needs including access to health service, housing, education, transportation, vocational training, employment, income 
						generating opportunities as well as other social and community activities. inspite of having the responsibility of 
						Bangladesh government to include women in the development process, but all mainstreaming policies have been formulated 
						and declared exclusive of women with disabilities.

								<h3>Founder's Message</h3>
							</a>
							<p class="text">
								As a Women with Disabilities, after having been perceived the imperceptible, insubstantial 
								discrimination of different institutions as well as everlasting discrimination of the society; 
								In 2003, on the basis of discussion, a group of educated Women With different types of disabilities 
								come to a decision that, we should have a preset platform of Women With Disabilities; from 
								where we will be able to raise our voice with Government along with Non-Government organizations 
								to condense discrimination against Women With Disabilities. After that/Subsequently, for four years, 
								to adopt different programs about Women With disabilities, on the perspective of the demands and 
								opinions of Women With disabilities through organizing them; in November 2007, our group has obtained 
								registration in the name of Women with Disabilities Development Foundation (WDDF) from Join Stock 
								Companies and Firms. In the consequence of Unanimous dedication, hard work and concentration, WWDs 
								themselves have established WDDF as a resource organization of their own. For the advancement of WDDF, 
								a number of well wishers, allies and donor organizations have come forward and we would like to express 
								our interminable gratitude to them. WDDF has expectation along with intention to work for all types
								of WWDs around the country in accordance with itâ€™s capability. It is an unique dream of WDDF that, WWDs
								will be honoured through their job and they will be able to keep contribution in socio-economic development
								of the state. WDDF is the own voice of Women with Disabilities; which will established a dignified society
								for them through preventing persecution along with eliminating discrimination.
