""" Loading or saving a model from or to a pickled form. The initial
model is loaded using Wavefront obj model loading as in LoadModelObj.py.

KEY 'd' will save the model as models/teapot.pkl and subsequent runs of the
program will load from that file.

Loading is much faster from a pickled file but the size is quite a bit
bigger; in this demo 282k+7k+37k+36k => 1.5M in python3 or 4.6M in python2
This is almost certainly because of the images, so with larger images it
may be worth pickling without the Textures and adding these after loading.
