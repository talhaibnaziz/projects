okay start of second day and i am still holding alright i think at least until now.
although its only the second day i am already noticing a lot of improvement and now i think why didnt i do this
sooner anyways not to be too proud as i still gotta keep this up sooo cant get carried away just yet.
already had some problems and have got to overcome them fast if i wanna keep my normal pace like this.
and also to find things to write out of the blue for a period of thiirty minutes is tougher than i thought
and is easy to write true things than just to make things up but then there would be risk of spilling some
secrets that would not be very wise of me although i am not very wise to begin with still that would be like
overkill :'|. and after writing for a few days i have to start practising smileys, and caps and then numbers too.
but just finishing this will be a great acheivement. at least for stupid me anyway. and have to keep a check on
my real speed too. an easy way would be to keep a count of words every time after i finish writing that is after each
of the thirty minutes break and am making a lot of mistakes so this real count is real important i think.
well at least there wont be any scarcity of backspace practice hehehe :p. well thats that and as today is my first real
practice i am going to stop here altough its just 21 minutes still bye for now.
