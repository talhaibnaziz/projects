Assalamu Alaikum everyone,
Yesterday (16/03/2020) at 7 pm, a four hour long contest held in Virtual judge, which is the first
contest in IUT with automated rating system. The rated contest had 13 problems and about 56 participants.
Here are some highlights of the contest:
1. The highest number of problems (10) were solved jointly by "zedrex" (Adib Abrar Kabeer) and "pranonraian" (Raian Rahman) - omanush er dol
2. The most solved problem was problem number "A - Even Numbers" (55 solves) and the highest number of attempts was for problem "D - Intersections" (166 attempts)
3. The problems "G - DSU", "K - Easier Math" (Not so easy afterall), and "L - FFW (Fast Floyd Warshall)", were unsolved.
4. The problem solved earliest was problem "A" again solved just after 1 min 31 seconds by "sivan_iut".

The performance was amazing, I mean who solves problem "B - Gimme them candy, No Slash gimme my candy" in 9 and a half minutes!
I mean even reading the title took me 1 min, let alone the big problem statement. This goes to show how much time our participants
have been spending relentlessly the last few days to improve their coding skills. However, this only applies to a few participants,
as the amount of participation was not satisfactory. Hopefully, we will have more participants in the next contest, because, trust me when I say this, you will need this.

Again, congratulations to "zedrex" (Adib Abrar Kabeer) and "pranonraian" (Raian Rahman).
