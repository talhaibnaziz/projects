Assalamu Alaikum everyone,

During these trying times, please follow the advices given during the contests as announcements. Recent sources suggests the virus does not only target old and sick people. So please stay at home, take precautions and pray to the Almighty. If He wants to save you, NO ONE can harm you.

Highlights of the IUT Individual Contest 3 (Div-2)
1. A total of 13 problems and 95 participants (wow, the number of participants just keeps increasing... awesome)
2. Highest number of problems solved (8) by "Auler" and "santner" (Shantanu) - Finally some new faces (or names)
3. The most tempting and the most solved problem was Problem "K - Kilo" with 170 attempts and 86 solves.
4. The problem solved earliest was Problem "K - Kilo" again and it was solved by omanush zedrex (Adib Abrar Kabeer) at 6 min 02 seconds after the start of the contest.
5. The problems "C- Charlie" and "D - Delta" were unsolved and the problem ""L - Lima" was unattempted.

As there were a few unique solvers, lets have a loot at them:
1. Problem "J - Juliett" was solved only by "Poushi" (Poushi-(190042113)) who had 3 more solves. Wait, the student ID suggests its a first year student.. mane ki? First year ei omanush naki!!! 36 attempts! by many badass coders, and this first year beat them all! Respect!
2. Problem "B - Bravo" was solved only by "Tashdid" which is his only solve. Only 4 attempts for this problem indicates how hard it is.

So again, congratulations to "Auler" and "Santner" (Shantanu).
